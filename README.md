This repository contains the code to reproduce the modeling figures of the paper by Prindle et al, published in Nature 527, 59–63, 2015 (doi: [10.1038/nature15709] (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15709)). It includes the following:

* [`fig3d.ipynb`](fig3d.ipynb): self-contained Jupyter notebook to generate Figure 3d from the paper.
* [`fig3e.ipynb`](fig3e.ipynb): Jupyter notebook to generate Figure 3e. This notebook compiles and runs the C program `embryo_v1.c`, and plots the correspoding results. It requires the C compiler `cc` and the utility `make`, which are available by default in Linux, or by installing the `Xcode` development environment in Mac OS X.
